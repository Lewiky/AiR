# AiR

AiR is a project worked on by tech startup Limoncello for the ESA's Frascati App Camp 2017.

AiR is an app that allows users to explore the world below their flight. By taking flight data, along with that of the RAMANI API, it provides an Augmented Reality experience to learn about the view from the plane. By combining RAMANI data about wind speeds, snow coverage, weather patterns and up-to-date day and night imagery, we offer a comprehensive look around their seat.

It consists of an iPhone app that uses Apple's ARKit to provide real time statistics on the world around you, specifically in flight.
